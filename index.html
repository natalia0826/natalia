      <li>I like traveling</li>
      <p>I have traveled to 15 countries so far, and I believe that traveling broadens perspectives, fosters personal growth, and enhances understanding of diverse cultures,
        ultimately enriching oneâ€™s life experiences. It also creates lasting memories, helps build friendships across the globe, and offers unique opportunities to learn and adapt, 
        resulting in a deeper appreciation for the richness of human diversity.</p>

      <li>I enjoy coding a lot</li>
      <p>I am passionate about coding because it empowers me to transform my ideas into practical solutions that address real-world challenges. The exhilaration of crafting a project from
        scratch, overcoming complex bugs, and ultimately sharing my creations with others provides a profound sense of accomplishment and fuels my continuous desire to learn and innovate.</p>

        <li>I go to Pilates classes</li>
      <p>I appreciate Pilates because it combines strength training with mindfulness, allowing me to connect deeply with my body while improving my flexibility and posture. The focus on
        precise movements and breathing not only enhances my physical strength but also provides a calming and restorative experience for my mind.</p>
